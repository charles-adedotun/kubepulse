# KubePulse AI-Powered GitHub Workflows

This directory contains advanced GitHub Actions workflows powered by Claude AI to automate code review, merge decisions, and provide interactive assistance for the KubePulse project.

## ü§ñ Available Workflows

### 1. Claude Code Review (`claude-code-review.yml`)
**Triggers**: Pull request events (opened, synchronized, reopened)

**Features**:
- Comprehensive AI-powered code reviews using Claude Sonnet 4
- KubePulse-specific analysis focusing on:
  - Go backend best practices and Kubernetes integration
  - React/TypeScript frontend code quality
  - AI/ML algorithm correctness and performance
  - Security and performance considerations
  - Testing coverage and quality

**Output**: Detailed review comments and analysis artifacts

### 2. AI Merge Decision (`merge-decision.yml`)
**Triggers**: Pull request events and workflow completions

**Features**:
- Multi-stage decision process:
  1. **wait-for-checks**: Monitors CI/CD pipeline status
  2. **merge-decision**: AI analyzes PR quality and makes merge recommendation
  3. **auto-merge**: Automatically merges approved PRs

**Decision Outcomes**:
- ‚úÖ **APPROVE**: Auto-merge eligible PRs
- üëÄ **MANUAL_APPROVAL**: Requires human review
- ‚ùå **REJECT**: Generates TODO list for improvements

### 3. Interactive Claude Assistance (`claude.yml`)
**Triggers**: `@claude` mentions in issues, PRs, and comments

**Features**:
- Specialized KubePulse expertise in:
  - Go development and Kubernetes integration
  - React/TypeScript frontend development
  - AI/ML anomaly detection algorithms
  - Testing strategies and coverage improvement
  - Kubernetes monitoring best practices

**Usage**: Mention `@claude` in any issue or PR comment to get AI assistance

### 4. Enhanced CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
**Triggers**: Push to main branch and pull requests

**Features**:
- Comprehensive testing pipeline:
  - Backend Go tests with race detection
  - Frontend React/TypeScript tests
  - Security scanning (Gosec, Nancy, npm audit)
  - Linting and formatting checks
  - Docker build and integration tests
  - Performance benchmarks
  - AI quality assessment

## üõ†Ô∏è Supporting Scripts

### `generate-merge-prompt.sh`
Creates structured prompts for AI merge decisions including:
- PR context and metadata
- CI/CD status summary
- Review status and commit history
- KubePulse-specific evaluation criteria

### `generate-todo-list.sh`
Generates actionable TODO lists for rejected PRs with:
- Issue-specific action items
- KubePulse development guidelines
- Testing and quality requirements
- Links to relevant documentation

## üîß Setup and Configuration

### Required Secrets
Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY          # Your Anthropic Claude API key
CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN    # Claude Code OAuth token for interactive features
```

### Permissions
The workflows require these GitHub permissions:
- `contents: read/write` - Repository access
- `pull-requests: write` - PR comments and management
- `issues: write` - Issue comments
- `actions: read` - CI status checking
- `checks: read` - Check run status

## üìã Workflow Integration

### AI Review Process
1. **Code Review**: Claude analyzes every PR for quality, security, and KubePulse-specific concerns
2. **CI Integration**: Workflows wait for all CI checks to complete
3. **Merge Decision**: AI makes informed merge recommendations based on:
   - Code quality and test coverage
   - Security scan results
   - KubePulse architectural compliance
   - Performance implications

### Auto-Merge Criteria
For a PR to be auto-merged, it must:
- ‚úÖ Pass all CI/CD checks
- ‚úÖ Receive AI approval from Claude review
- ‚úÖ Meet KubePulse quality standards
- ‚úÖ Have adequate test coverage
- ‚úÖ Pass security scans

### Manual Review Triggers
PRs require manual review when:
- Complex architectural changes
- New AI/ML algorithm implementations
- Security-sensitive modifications
- Breaking changes to APIs
