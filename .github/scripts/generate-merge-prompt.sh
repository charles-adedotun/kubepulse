## Decision Request

Based on the above context and KubePulse-specific criteria, make a merge decision.

**Required Response Format (JSON):**
\`\`\`json
{
  "decision": "APPROVE|MANUAL_APPROVAL|REJECT",
  "reason": "Clear explanation of the decision",
  "critical_issues": ["list", "of", "critical", "issues", "if", "any"],
  "recommended_action": "Specific next steps or improvements needed"
}
\`\`\`

**Decision Guidelines:**
- **APPROVE**: All checks pass, code quality is excellent, no security concerns, comprehensive tests
- **MANUAL_APPROVAL**: Good code quality but requires human review for complex changes or edge cases
- **REJECT**: Critical issues, security problems, failing tests, or significant quality concerns

**Focus Areas for KubePulse:**
- Kubernetes monitoring accuracy and reliability
- AI/ML algorithm correctness and performance
- Health check logic validity
- Dashboard usability and responsiveness
- System scalability and resource efficiency

Please provide your decision with specific, actionable reasoning based on the PR content and KubePulse's requirements.
